This directory contains example scripts demonstrating how to use the pb-aesa package.

## basic_usage.py

Demonstrates the basic workflow:
- Setting up LCIA methods for planetary boundaries
- Running a MultiLCA assessment
- Calculating exploitation of Safe Operating Space
- Visualizing results

To run this example, you need:
1. A Brightway25 project with ecoinvent data
2. The pb-aesa package installed
3. Required dependencies (bw2data, bw2calc, pandas, matplotlib, etc.)

```bash
python basic_usage.py
```

Note: Make sure to adjust the project name and database names to match your setup.
